Personal Introduction:
This is "Legally" Losstng, or Hoang Hai Long Do's first ever project for coding or programming.
It is a hands on learning project where I attempt to tackle everything as a Business Law student.
I prior to this have only advance knowledge of Excel VBA, and now already having a full-stack Chatbot.
This is only a project to learn, and to showcase everything I had learned and is capable of.
Through this project, on everyline of code, I have written at least some comments to enforce my knowledge on programming.
I am very proud of myself on taking this leap into this brand new world. :D
